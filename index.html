   <h3>About this Application</h3>
   <p>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the
     week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.
     Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given
     their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
   To get your anka name, please fill the details in the form provided below, choose your gender
   and then click on the submit button.</p>
